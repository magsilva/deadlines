You pay for your seat through the value of your participation. Participation in the workshop is by invitation based on a proposal. We expect to accept 15 participants with an absolute upper bound of 25.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWTST is a workshop, not a typical conference. Our presentations serve to drive discussion. The target readers of workshop papers are the other participants, not archival readers. We are glad to start from already-published papers, if they are presented by the author and they would serve as a strong focus for valuable discussion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a typical presentation, the presenter speaks 10 to 90 minutes, followed by discussion. There is no fixed time for discussion. Past sessions'' discussions have run from 1 minute to 4 hours. During the discussion, a participant might ask the presenter simple or detailed questions, describe consistent or contrary experiences or data, present a different approach to the same problem, or (respectfully and collegially) argue with the presenter. In 20 hours of formal sessions, we expect to cover six to eight presentations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe also have lightning presentations, time-limited to 5 minutes (plus discussion). These are fun and they often stimulate extended discussions over lunch and at night.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPresenters must provide materials that they share with the workshop under a Creative Commons license, allowing reuse by other teachers. Such materials will be posted at http://www.wtst.org.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBACKGROUND AND SUGGESTED TOPICS\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur focus is on implementation-level testing. We are interested in the types of tests that programmers write to understand and assess their own code. These include unit tests and lower-level integration tests. Presentations on “acceptance-test driven development” are out of scope of this meeting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe were excited by the rise of interest in implementation-level testing that came with the agile development movement. Unfortunately, test-driven development seems to have been lightly adopted by the agile development community; even less formal approaches to unit testing appear to be minority practices ( see for example, http://www.agilealliance.org/show/1546,  http://www.techworld.com.au/article/256619/unit_testing_doomed, and http://agile.dzone.com/videos/scott-ambler-agile-2009). Our impression is that unit testing has been gradually becoming less visible and less central in the agile community. Practitioners believe it is hard to do this well (http://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/practices2009.html) and we’ve been finding that it is hard to teach it well.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPerhaps part of the problem is that the books that introduced unit testing to new and relatively junior programmers are out of date. The newer books and online articles that we’ve seen are written for more experienced programmers. Most writing that we’ve seen focuses on test implementation (such as how to use the tools, how to create maintainable test suites, how to test private variables, etc.) rather than on what tests to run and why to run them. We haven’t seen much that is suitable for university courses that would be appropriate for average students or for commercial introductions to the practice of TDD.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, what can we use, or what can we develop for use in our courses?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere are *examples* of ideas that might be interesting to the participants at WTST:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Course design: We’re looking for experience reports, not theory. We’re interested in your report if you have made a significant effort at teaching implementation-level testing and have insight into your successes, failures and challenges.\r\n\r\n·         Online course design: There are a lot of programming courses online. Are any of them good? Can we adapt their instructional methods to create online courses that emphasize implementation-level testing? (Not many universities will teach such courses—some good online courses can create learning opportunities for a broader pool of university students and commercial students.)\r\n\r\n·         Instructive examples: Do you have particularly successful activities or assignments? What are their details? What do students learn? How do you know? What problems do students have in attempting these and how do you recommend that we deal with them (if we reuse your activity)?\r\n\r\n·         Resources for implementation-level test-related activities and assignments:  we have all heard of MERLOT and NSDL and several other repositories of learning objects. Have you found any good resources for software testing in any of these repositories? What have you found? How did you search? Can you give a demo, including your search strategy?\r\n\r\n·         Assessment: What techniques should we use to determine whether our assignments and activities are working? Have you used these assessment techniques? Can you give examples?\r\n\r\n·         Qualitative assessment methods: From sloppy anecdotal reports to rigorous qualitative design. How can we use qualitative methods to conduct research on the teaching of computing, including software testing? \r\n\r\n·         Differences in characteristics of learners that predict differences in effectiveness of activities or assignments\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTO ATTEND AS A PRESENTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease send a proposal BY DECEMBER 15, 2009 to Cem Kaner <kaner@cs.fit.edu> that identifies who you are, what your background is, what you would like to present, how long the presentation will take, any special equipment needs, and what written materials you will provide. Along with traditional presentations, we will gladly consider proposed activities and interactive demonstrations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe will begin reviewing proposals on December 1. We encourage early submissions. It is unlikely but possible that we will have accepted a full set of presentation proposals by December 15.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals should be between two and four pages long, in PDF format. We will post accepted proposals to http://www.wtst.org.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe review proposals in terms of their contribution to knowledge of HOW TO TEACH software testing. Proposals that present a purely theoretical advance in software testing, with weak ties to teaching and application, will not be accepted. Presentations that reiterate materials you have presented elsewhere might be welcome, but it is imperative that you identify the publication history of such work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBy submitting your proposal, you agree that, if we accept your proposal, you will submit a scholarly paper for discussion at the workshop by January 15, 2010. Workshop papers may be of any length and follow any standard scholarly style. We will post these at http://www.wtst.org as they are received, for workshop participants to review before the workshop.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTO ATTEND AS A NON-PRESENTING PARTICIPANT:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease send a message by DECEMBER 15, 2008, to Cem Kaner <kaner@cs.fit.edu> that describes your background and interest in teaching software testing. What skills or knowledge do you bring to the meeting that would be of interest to the other participants?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nADVISORY BOARD MEETING\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFlorida Tech''s Center for Software Testing Education & Research has been developing a collection of hybrid and online course materials for teaching black box software testing. We have NSF funding to adapt these materials for implementation by a broader audience. We have formed an Advisory Board to guide this adaptation and the associated research on the effectiveness of the materials in diverse contexts. We are interested in having a few new members. The Board will meet before WTST, on January 28, 2010.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis year’s meeting will focus on supporting/creating research collaborations by members of the Board. Our primary interest lies in expanding the community doing research/development on software testing education.\r\n\r\n·         The Center is interested in being involved in new proposals, but we want to foster good ideas at this meeting whether they involve the Center or not.\r\n\r\n·         The Center is interested in encouraging adoption, evaluation and improvement of the course materials that we’ve developed, but again, we are primarily interested in fostering good ideas at this meeting, not in promoting any particular set of ideas or materials.\r\n\r\n·         The Center’s work has primarily focused on system-level black box testing. The Advisory Board meeting is open to system-level ideas as well as implementation-level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you are interested attending as a Board Member:\r\n\r\n·         If you are not already a member of the Board, please read this invitation and submit an application.\r\n\r\n·         If you are already a member and are willing to come on January 28, please let us know ASAP.\r\n\r\n·         In either case, please let us know whether you plan to stay for WTST.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMost of our NSF funding has been exhausted. We have some additional money for this from donations. However at this point, we can only afford to cover  hotel costs of advisory board members who attend the meeting and WTST. We cannot reimburse airfare. We’ll discuss this in more detail in correspondence with the Advisory Board.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSupport for this meeting comes from the National Science Foundation, the Association for Software Testing and the Harris Institute for Assured Information at the Florida Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe hosts of the meeting are:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Scott Barber (http://www.perftestplus.com)\r\n\r\n·         Rebecca Fiedler (http://www.beckyfiedler.com)\r\n\r\n·         Cem Kaner (http://www.kaner.com and http://www.testingeducation.org)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCem Kaner, J.D., Ph.D.\r\n\r\nProfessor of Software Engineering, Florida Institute of Technology\r\n\r\nwww.kaner.com\r\n\r\nwww.testingeducation.org\r\n\r\nhttp://www.satisfice.com/kaner/');

Tais situações caracterizam-se pelo deslocamento das\r\nconcepções hierárquicas e disciplinares de ensino e direcionam-se para a\r\nconcepção do conhecimento interdisciplinar em um modelo de "rede de\r\nrelações".\r\n\r\nAs arquiteturas pedagógicas abertas permitem que os estudantes realizem\r\natividades cognitivamente instigantes e desenvolvam métodos de trabalho\r\ninterativos e construtivos. Como exemplo de propostas pedagógicas que\r\nderam origem às arquiteturas, podemos citar: Projetos de Aprendizagem,\r\nEstudo de Caso ou Resolução de Problema, Aprendizagem Incidente, Ação\r\nSimulada.\r\n\r\nObjetivos Com este workshop pretende-se: promover a apresentação e\r\navaliação de materiais pedagógicos inovadores que explorem as diferentes\r\ncontribuições do conceito de Arquiteturas Pedagógicas na concepção de\r\ndesenhos abertos para a educação a distância; promover um inventário das\r\ndiversas pesquisas e desenvolvimento de materiais educacionais e\r\nambientes virtuais associados ao conceito de Arquiteturas Pedagógicas;\r\npromover a articulação entre pesquisadores e contribuir para a\r\nconsolidação de uma rede nacional de pesquisa em produção de materiais\r\ndidáticos interativos para Educação Mediada pela Internet.\r\n\r\nTópicos de Interesses (Não exclusivos) Materiais pedagógicos para a EAD;\r\nObjetos interativos de aprendizagem; Inovação curricular com o uso da\r\ntelemática; Propostas pedagógicas para EAD mediada pela Internet e seus\r\nmateriais; Arquiteturas pedagógicas; Concepções teóricas e metodológicas\r\npara os materiais pedagógicos interativos; Aportes teórico-metodológicos\r\npara a compreensão da aprendizagem mediada pela tecnologia.

The\r\nindustrial interest stems from the fact that bytecode is typically\r\nused for Internet and mobile devices (smart-cards, phones, etc.)\r\napplications, where security is a major issue. Moreover, bytecode is\r\ndevice-independent and allows dynamic loading of classes, which\r\nprovides an extra challenge for the application of formal methods. In\r\naddition, the unstructuredness of the code and the pervasive presence\r\nof the operand stack also provide extra challenges for the analysis of\r\nbytecode.  This workshop will focus on theoretical and practical\r\naspects of semantics, verification, analysis, certification and\r\ntransformation of bytecode. Both new theoretical results and tool\r\ndemonstrations are welcome.\r\n\r\nProgram committee:\r\n\r\n * David Aspinall, University of Edinburgh, Scotland\r\n * Stephen Chong, Harvard University, USA\r\n * Alessandro Coglio, Kestrel Institute, USA\r\n * Pierre Crégut, Orange Labs, France Télécom, France\r\n * Samir Genaim, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain\r\n * Bart Jacobs, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium\r\n * Gerwin Klein, University of New South Wales, Australia\r\n * Victor Kuncak, EPFL, Switzerland\r\n * Patrick Lam, University of Waterloo, Canada\r\n * Francesco Logozzo, Microsoft Research, USA\r\n * Matthew Parkinson, University of Cambridge, UK\r\n * David Pichardie (chair), INRIA Rennes, France\r\n * Rene Rydhof Hansen, Aalborg University, Denmark\r\n * Fausto Spoto, University of Verona, Italy\r\n\r\nPaper Submission:\r\n\r\nThere are two paper categories, Regular and Tool demo papers.

Applied to ontology engineering, modularity is central not only to reduce the complexity of understanding ontologies, but also to facilitate ontology maintenance and ontology reasoning.\r\n\r\nRecent research on ontology modularity shows substantial progress in foundations of modularity, techniques of modularization and modular development, distributed reasoning and empirical evaluation. These results provide a foundation for further research and development.\r\n\r\nThe workshop follows a series of successful events that have been an excellent venue for practitioners and researchers to discuss latest work and current problems, and is this time organised as a satellite workshop of FOIS 2010, as well as being co-located with several other relevant events, namely KR, AAMAS, ICAPS, NMR, and DL.\r\n\r\nTOPICS include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- What is Modularity: Kinds of modules and their properties; modules vs. contexts; design patterns; granularity of representation;\r\n\r\n- Logical/Foundational Studies: Conservativity; modular ontology languages (e.g., DDL, E-Connections, P-DL); reconciling inconsistencies across modules; formal structuring of modules; heterogeneity;\r\n\r\n- Algorithmic Approaches: distributed reasoning; modularization and module extraction; (selective) sharing and re-using, linking and importing; hiding and privacy; evaluation of modularization approaches; complexity of reasoning; reasoners or implemented systems;\r\n\r\n- Applications: Semantic Web; Life Sciences; Bio-Ontologies; Natural Language Processing; ontologies of space and time; Ambient Intelligence; collaborative ontology development; etc.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DATES\r\n\r\nPaper Submission: January 29, 2010\r\nNotification:  March 1, 2010\r\nCamera ready: March 11, 2010\r\nWorkshop day: May 11, 2010\r\n\r\nSUBMISSION GUIDELINES:\r\n\r\nThe workshop welcomes submission of high quality original and previously unpublished papers.\r\n\r\nContributions should not exceed 13 pages in length and must be formatted according to IOS Press style (see http://www.iospress.nl/authco/instruction_crc.html ).\r\nContributions should be prepared in PDF format and submitted not later than January 29 2010 through the EasyChair Submission System (see http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~okutz/womo4 ).\r\n\r\nSubmitted papers will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee.

In 2007 the conference aimed to harness an international perspective on the ‘big issues’ in mobile learning by discussing topics such as the conflict between personal informal learning and traditional classroom education, the evaluation of mobile learning and appropriate methods for this setting, the design of mobile learning activities and the integration of mobile devices in the broader educational scenarios, among others. In 2008, our concern was to explore various dimensions of the learners’ mobility for example, physical, conceptual and social, to discern how these in conjunction with mobile and fix technologies may support learning. Last year, the conference debated the increasing phenomenon of user generated content, in particular mobil!\r\n e media.\r\n\r\nFive years on, the IADIS Mobile Learning 2010 International Conference seeks to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of mobile learning research which provides a retrospective outlook of the field. We seek contributions under the topics below which illustrate developments in the field.\r\n\r\n* Format of the Conference\r\nThe conference will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the form of a book and CD-ROM with ISBN, and will be available also in the IADIS Digital Library (accessible on-line).\r\nThe best paper authors will be invited to publish extended versions of their papers in the IADIS Journal on Computer Science and Information Systems (ISSN: 1646-3692) and also in other selected Journals.\r\n\r\n* Types of submissions\r\nFull and Short Papers, Reflection Papers, Posters/Demonstrations, Tutorials, Panels and Doctoral Consortium.

In many e-learning applications, LOs can be help to structure the organization of important concepts and their retrieval through indexed terms. To facilitate the explanation of difficult concepts in specific subject area(s), pictures or video files can be flexibly embedded into LOs. However, due to the high complexity of the designed structures adapted for LOs that will simply discourage their reuses, and also the huge costs involved in the re-engineering of existing e-learning platforms and their integration, the possible advantages of LOs and their supporting technologies cannot be fully unveiled in many existing e-learning platforms in the last decade so as to evolve into enabling technologies for next generation learning. Therefore, the challenging issues that need to be addressed in the applications of LOs and their s!\r\n upporting technologies to existing e-learning platforms include, but are not limited to, the following topics:\r\n- prominent techniques/tools that help to make LOs as enabling techniques for next generation learning;\r\n- effective re-engineering methodologies/tools that can facilitate the integration of LOs into existing e-learning systems;\r\n- enabling methodologies/tools that can promote reuses of LOs within the same or across different disciplines;\r\n- distributed processing or mobile computing techniques to facilitate the application or retrieval of LOs in existing e-learning systems;\r\n- intelligent image/video storage and distribution system to facilitate the retrieval of relevant multimedia files embedded in LOs;\r\n- integration of LOs with other interesting e-learning technologies such as game based learning systems.\r\n\r\nWe invite short articles, case studies, and project reports for October issue.
