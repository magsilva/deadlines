Deadlines is a publication management application.

Every researcher has the duty of publishing the results of their work
(otherwise, the research has no real meaning, has it?). However, the
available conferences and journals are too many to be tracked without
any aid: check the announcements in public lists, access and read those
announcements, keep track of the deadlines (and its extensions!),
coordinate the writing of the paper, to name the main (but not only)
activities. Actually, it is a real burden to handle it all. So here
came the 'Deadlines' tool!

The first thing you will find when accessing 'Deadlines' is the list
of currently available publication sites, be them events (conferences,
workshops, etc) or periodicals (journals, magazines). The main
informations are readly displayed: name, place and deadline of the
call for papers. Colors are used to highlight the closest deadlines
and font weights are used to specify the importance of the publication
(given a classification mechanism such as Qualis).

After selecting a publication, it is possible to define papers you would
like to submit. This will set up a version control repository for the
paper, repository which you can share with other researchers. No more
email exchange asking for files: everything will be in the repository,
readly available!
